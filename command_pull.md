# Docker ```pull``` command

The Docker ```pull``` command is used to download an image.

    > docker pull <image>[:<tag>]

If you don't specify any tags, Docker will consider the default tag to be **latest**.  The ```latest``` tag is associated to the latest version of that software, which is governed by the authors of their software.
